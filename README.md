# 🧠 Enterprise Workflow Automation Agent (Google ADK / Gemini 2.5)

A fully working **multi-agent enterprise workflow automation system**, built using  
**Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite**.

This project demonstrates a production-ready pattern for:
- multi-agent orchestration  
- PTO/HR workflows  
- policy enforcement  
- finance calculations  
- persistent session memory  
- tool calling  
- evaluation suite  
- end-to-end automation demo  

The entire system runs locally inside a single notebook with **zero external services**,  
making it ideal for demos, learning, and portfolio showcasing.
